        <p id="P1">Although considerable variation exists, the basic profile for Nigerian
        jollof rice includes long-grain parboiled rice, tomatoes and tomato paste,
        pepper, vegetable oil, onions, and stock cubes. Most of the ingredients are
        cooked in one pot, of which a rich meat stock and a fried tomato and pepper
        puree characteristically forms the base.</p>  
        
        <p id="P2">Rice is then added and left to cook in the liquid. The dish is then served 
        with the protein of choice and very often with fried plantains, moi moi, steamed 
        vegetables, coleslaw, salad, etc. 
        In the riverine areas of Nigeria where seafood is the main source of protein,
        seafood often takes the place of chicken or meat as the protein of choice.</p>
